# WebScrape
WebScrape is a command line utility designed with Python 3.6 designed for data analysis on Wikipedia articles.

WebScrape is written purely in Python and is designed to grab an HTML page, internet or local, and the data contained in HTML tags (of which you specify). After grabbing this data, WebScrape will then get the number of hits your data has gotten on Wikipedia. By default, WebScrape will find the number of times a page has been viewed in the last 60 days. You can change this via the source code.
